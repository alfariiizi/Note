# IDE Configuration

Every time have a new system machine (like try new OS, Reinstall OS, etc. that can cause fresh install to the machine), and then wanna use vscode. Just use [keybindings](keybindings.json) as a keybindings configurations, and [settings](settings.json) as a setting configurations. You can copy the contents inside of those file in the new configuration files.
Or you can just copy those file in `~/.config/Code/User/`.
